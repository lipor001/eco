# Research Statement

The purpose of this research is to study the ecologcial interactions between marine macroalgae and small invertebrate epifauna.  This is important for the universe. 

# Objectives
1. Collect samples of macroalgae and invertebrate epifauna.
2. Identify the macroalgae and invertebrate epifauna to lowest possible taxonomic level.
3. Correlate the environmental and spatiotemporal parameters with the diversity of macroalgae, the invertebrate epifauna, and their associations.  

# Hypotheses
1. ABC
2. XYZ
3. TUR

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
